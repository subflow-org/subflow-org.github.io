# Command Structure
# "command : argument : duration (beats)"
#   string :  double  :      uint32
#
# Possible commands
#
# BPM - set BPM; argument is the BPM, 20.0 <= BPM <= 480.0
# SPD - set glide speed; argument is the speed, 0.3 <= SPD <= 6.3
# SCL - set pulse scale (1.0 = no pulsing); argument scales the beat pulses, 0.7 <= SCL <= 1.3
# COL - set color; uses 64-bit RGB palette with two bits per channel (see https://subflow.org/palette.jpg)
# MOD - set viz mode; argument is cast to an int to become the mode, 0 <= MOD <= 7 
#	  - duration should be (measure length - 1) to account for the mode transition beat
# LOP - jump to any valid command; argument is the jmp index (1-based, excluding header)
#     - here the duration is the number of loops; 0 <= duration <= 2e9; duration 0 is the same as duration 2e9
